# Hangman - game

###### def: 
#### Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. This is a digital version of a paper-and-pencil game. 

###### rules:

A word is randomly choosen from the list. For each letter of each word there are marked out blanks (short lines). Then a player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word(s) then the letter is written in everywhere it would appear. That letter is crossed out in the alphabet then. If the letter isn't in the word then a body part is added to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word or all six body parts are on the gallows.

TO WIN: The executioner wins if the full body is hanging from the gallows. The guesser(s) wins if they guess the word before the person is hung.
